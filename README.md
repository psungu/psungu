# Hello, I'm Pınar Süngü İşiaçık! 👋

I'm a dedicated Machine Learning Engineer specialized in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and leveraging AWS technologies to build scalable AI solutions. With a rich background in deploying deep learning and machine learning algorithms for complex forecasting and classification tasks, I excel in using RNN, CNN, XGBoost, and discriminant analysis to drive innovation. I’m passionate about exploring transformers and GPT to advance language understanding and generation capabilities.

🔭 I'm presently focusing on employing state-of-the-art NER models with transformer architectures and cutting-edge image embedding techniques for product information extraction and identification.

🌱 I’m on a continuous learning path, currently delving deeper into Kubernetes, Jenkins, Docker, and FastAPI for optimizing AI model deployment and system performance.

👯 Open to collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of NLP and AI, particularly those that harness the power of transformers and cloud technologies to solve real-world problems.

💬 Feel free to ask me about deploying scalable machine learning models, NLP advancements, or any AWS technologies.
